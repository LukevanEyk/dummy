(Verse 1)
In the heart of the city, where the people all roam,
There's a man named Wikus, he's got a heart like a home.
With a smile that's as bright as the African sun,
He's the kind of guy who'll make you feel like you've won.

(Chorus)
Oh, Wikus, you're a gem, a true friend indeed,
With your kindness and warmth, you plant love like a seed.
You lift up our spirits, make the world seem so fine,
In your presence, my friend, everything's in its prime.

(Verse 2)
Through the troubles and trials, you stand tall and strong,
With compassion and grace, you right every wrong.
In the darkest of nights, you're a beacon of light,
Guiding us through, making everything feel right.

(Chorus)
Oh, Wikus, you're a gem, a true friend indeed,
With your kindness and warmth, you plant love like a seed.
You lift up our spirits, make the world seem so fine,
In your presence, my friend, everything's in its prime.

(Bridge)
When the world gets too heavy, and we stumble and fall,
You're the one who's there to answer the call.
With a heart full of love and a soul pure and bright,
You make everything better, you make everything right.

(Verse 3)
In a world that can often be cold and unkind,
You're the warmth in our hearts, the peace in our mind.
You're the reason we cherish each day that we see,
Oh, Wikus, my friend, you're the best there can be.

(Chorus)
Oh, Wikus, you're a gem, a true friend indeed,
With your kindness and warmth, you plant love like a seed.
You lift up our spirits, make the world seem so fine,
In your presence, my friend, everything's in its prime.

(Outro)
So here's to Wikus, a chap so nice and true,
May your days be filled with joy in all that you do.
With your heart of gold shining, you light up the way,
In our hearts, you'll forever and always stay.
