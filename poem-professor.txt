In Pretoria's halls of learning, I take my stand,
A professor of engineering, with a vision grand.
I've journeyed through circuits, codes, and design,
In the pursuit of knowledge, I constantly refine.

With a chalk in hand, I step to the board,
To unravel the mysteries that engineering has stored.
Equations and formulas, they dance in the air,
As I guide my students with patience and care.

In the heart of Pretoria, where innovation thrives,
I nurture young minds to engineer their lives.
From bridges to buildings, and from circuits to cars,
I impart the wisdom to reach for the stars.

In the classroom, we forge a path to the future,
With every lesson, a spark, a vibrant suture.
For in the world of engineering, dreams take flight,
And in Pretoria's embrace, we reach new heights.

The hum of machines, the whir of technology,
In this realm of creation, we find our ecology.
From the ivory tower to the workshop floor,
Together we explore, innovate, and soar.

Through trials and errors, we learn to persist,
As engineers in training, we coexist.
With passion and knowledge, our hearts are on fire,
In Pretoria, we aim to inspire.

So here I stand, a professor so true,
In Pretoria University, where dreams come through.
With innovation as our guiding light,
Together we'll engineer a future so bright.
